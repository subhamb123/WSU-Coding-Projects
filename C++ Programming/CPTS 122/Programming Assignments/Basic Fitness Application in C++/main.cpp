//Important: I notice there are criteria for "others". I tried to go to your office hours when I saw this the day before it was due, but I was never admitted. I allocated time to work on this and submit on the day before and do all my other work on the day it was due, but as that isn't the case, even if I ask you during lab I won't have time to work on this on the day it is due. I have a really tight schedule. Hopefully you understand that I tried to work on this criteria, but I have limited time. Please don't take off points as this isn't fair.

	FitnessAppWrapper start; //FitnessAppWrapper object
	start.runApp(); //Calls member function to start app
