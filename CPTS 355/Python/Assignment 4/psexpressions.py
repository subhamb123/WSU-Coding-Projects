    "Value" objects represent the string , dictionary, and code-array constants that are pushed onto the stack.  
    
    In our interpreter,
        -  For simplicity, the integers and boolean values are pushed onto the opstack as integers and booleans, respectively. 
        -  Similarly, name constants (e.g. '/x') are pushed to the opstack as strings. 
        -  The string, dictionary, and code array constants are represented as StringValue, DictionaryValue, and CodeArrayValue objects, 
           which are subclasses of the `Value`. 
        -  StringValue, DictionaryValue, and CodeArrayValue implement the following methods in the `Value` interface:
            * apply : Evaluates the value. `apply` is only applicable to CodeArrayValue objects (applies the function, evaluates all the tokens in the function's code-array, i.e., CodeArrayValue )  
            * __str__: Conversts the value to  a human-readable version (i.e., string) for printing.
